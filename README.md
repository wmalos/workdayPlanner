# workdayPlanner

For this task I had to create a work day planner using javascript and html that allows a user to enter text in time slots and will then save to the computer.

Steps:

Created time blocks within the html
Used moments.js to add the current date in the header
Create click event for saving text in time blocks
Make sure that text saves to the local storage
Create a loop that sets color of blocks  based on time
Make planner usable on smaller screens
